		<h1>About VMP Muzik</h1>

   <p>Be the part of the movement where everything is possible we
    known as the movement that makes something out of nothing
    <cite>Visible music productions (VMP)</cite> is the Movement started
    with the idea of just trying to record some Hip Hop music in the
    Township of Zwelethemba,<br>
    Worcester just outside Cape Town. The movement started in the
    year 2010 by Ntabethemba Mabetshe, after struggling so much to find
    a place to record He then decide to get a Computer and hustle some
    software's like Cubase, <abbr title="Fruity Loops">FL</abbr>
    Studio. Even though He struggled to make beats at first at the end
    He finally figure it out how to lay down patterns, on <abbr title=
    "Fruity Loops">FL</abbr> Studio and the right Tempos for hip hop
    beats that was all He needed to know to get Him started with the
    recordings.</p> <br />

   <p>after the beginning of the recordings Maneza started
    distributing His Music amongst his friends and people he knew songs
    started to spread in Zwelethemba with Bluetooth sharing and the
    other ways, More Artists started to get interested in working with
    Maneza F8 at <abbr title="Visible Music Productions">VMP</abbr><br>
    Artists like Buso Baxa, Gladwell, Simamnkele, Ricardo, Sandile
    Xaba, Olwethu Ludidi, Vuyani Mini, Which the call themselves
    Visible Squad, they started by recording at another young dude's
    home studio called Sight records back in those days, they came with
    a Hit single titled Izwelethemba Neziyobisi (drugs in Zwelethemba).
    The track received so much love in a way that it spreaded in some
    other nearby townships and Visible squard was then popular as well
    as Maneza F8 who was then MC_MANEZA, there is no way you can talk
    about hip hop in Worcester, Zwelethemba without mentioning
    Mc_maneza and VMP MUZIK.</p>

    <p>Throughout the years <abbr title="visible muzik productions">VMP</abbr>
    has been a house hold name in WORCESTER. Maneza then started a group
    called <strong>Massive-link</strong> with one of the <em>Two</em>
    most talented young Rappers Sira-man and hard sentance a Hip Hop group
    that consists of <em>Three</em> talented rappers in late 2010 they
    recorded a track called <strong>Sathana suka emvakwam</strong>
    whih also featured in <strong>Maneza f8's</strong> Mixtape titled
    <em>IZIQHAMO ZENGQIQI</em>, Then many tracks followed that recieved lot of love
    in the streets and ended them a name in the worcester muzik scene.
    </p>

     <p><strong> <em>Five years later</em> <abbr title="Visible muzik productions">VMP</abbr>
     has recorded more than 100 tracks and more than 20 artists
     Maeza F8 tracks have been played on the radios, Maneza have recorded
     <em>Two</em> Mixtapes at <abbr title="Visible muzik productions">VMP</abbr>
     and Sold more than 400 copies out of both Tapes,
     in 2011 <abbr title="Visible muzik productions">VMP</abbr> signed
     <em>Six</em>artists with a <em>Three</em> Year contract deal,
     but then artist were not comited in their work which made it
     hard for <abbr title="Visible muzik productions">VMP</abbr>
     to honour the tearms of the agreement.
